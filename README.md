# Palimpsest
This repository contains a reproducible manuscript style I have created for R Markdown documents.

From the Oxford dictionary, a *palimpsest* is *a manuscript or piece of writing material on which later writing has been superimposed on effaced earlier writing.* It is *something reused or altered but still bearing visible traces of its earlier form.*

I felt this definition captures the essence of this manuscript template and is unique!
